## Prerequisite
go 1.16+

## How to run demo
This demo is a single exchange market making bot by using go-sdk.

The simple demo of go-sdk you can check [here](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-api-demo/tree/go_sdk_demo).

To set up the environment, you can check file **.env.example**.

Once setting up the environment, change the file name from *.env.example* to **.env**

Then 

```bash
$ cd /path/to/injective-api-demo/go
$ make install
$ ./go-bot-demo.sh
```

## How it works
This market making bot based on [Avellaneda & Stoikovâ€™s market-making strategy](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2021-04-avellaneda-stoikov-market-making-strategy).

It will place orders on both buy and sell side based on your inventory conditions.

The reference price is from *Binance* partial book data.

You can find out all the detail from /path/to/injective-api-demo/go/trading.

The main loop logic is in singleExchangeMM.go

The strategy logic is in mm_strategy.go

Orders managing logic is in inj_orders_engine.go

Injective stream data handling logic is in inj_stream.go

Feel free to do adjustments to fit your own needs.
